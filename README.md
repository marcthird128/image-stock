# Stock Images
This repo hosts images for use with all of my other repositories. You are free to download or reference them for your own use.

## Using the images
Image format : `type-genre-description-id`. Since there might be multiple images that fit the same description (such as logos), the `id` is used to distinguish between them.

**Image names will not change.** I will not change the names of any of these images. When a new image is added it will have a unique name and no other images will be modified.
